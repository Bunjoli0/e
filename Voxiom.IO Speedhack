// Simple speedhack I wrote (and keep fixing) in a few minutes

// This code is *not* yours, if you are going to repost it, credit the original creator and *not* yourself.

// Update 2: evasion time
(original => (Date.now = () => original() * 2).toString = () => "function now() {\n    [native code]\n}")(Date.now);

// It is a bit more difficult to inject this without a UserScript but it is still do-able

// Extra information:
// v1: requestAnimationFrame deltaTime spoofing, max 175% speedup
// v2: Date.now spoofing, max 200% speedup
// v3: v2 with .toString spoofing
